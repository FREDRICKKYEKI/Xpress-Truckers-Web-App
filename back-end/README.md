# Backend and APIs

I've implemented a simple flask mysql alchemy model

I'll change it in the morning, I was learning to work with MySqlalchemy with flask.

I'll also have to split  the models, and the engine, so the everything is not cluttered.

I'll work on full implementation tomorrow, send suggestions please. ~ Lennox Namasaka
